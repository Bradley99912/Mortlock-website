                            Contact with members of the Western Australian Police for most people often comes when they least expect it and can be a daunting process.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is important to always remain respectful and courteous when speaking to a police officer even if you feel that the police have no grounds to speak to you.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If you are asked by a member of the Western Australia Police for any of your identifying particulars, (name, date of birth and where you live), you must provide it to them. However once you have provided your identifying particulars you are under no further obligation to answer their questions, unless there is a legislative requirement to do so.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If the police officer informs you that there is a legislative requirement to provide particular details, ask the officer what the title of the legislation is and section number they are relying on to compel you to provide an answer.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is also important for you to pay attention to what the police officer is saying to you and if you do not understand the questions they are asking of you, ask them to explain the question.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Before answering any police questions we recommend speaking to one of our lawyers. If you or one of your family has been arrested and are being held in police custody we can provide advice either over the telephone or by attending the police station where you or your family member is being held.

                                If you have been arrested by the police it is important that you ask to be released on bail.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                What is bail?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Bail is a process which is regulated in Western Australia by the Bail Act 1982. It is where you make a promise to the Court that you will turn up at each court date until your case is finished.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The police or the court may also put certain conditions on your bail such as:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="our-services-text-dots">
                                <li>Not to consume alcohol.</li>
                                <li>Not to communicate with a particular person or persons</li>
                                <li>Restricting you from leaving your residence at certain times of the day or night (curfew).</li>
                                <li>Report to a police station a number of times a week.</li>
                                <li>To live at a specific address.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="our-services-text">
                                The Police or the Court may also require you to provide a surety. A surety is someone who is prepared to make sure you attend court and puts up a large sum of money which will be given to the Court if you do not attend.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The Court considers many things in determining whether a person should be granted bail and includes whether:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="our-services-text-dots">
                                <li>The person is likely to turn up to court on the next court date</li>
                                <li>The person is likely to commit further offences while on bail</li>
                                <li>The person might endanger the safety, welfare or property of another person</li>
                                <li>Any bail conditions can be imposed to lessen the likelihood the person doing any of the above.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="our-services-text">
                                The Court also looks at:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="our-services-text-dots">
                                <li>The seriousness of the charges and whether the person if convicted is likely to receive a term of imprisonment</li>
                                <li>The character of the person, and any previous criminal record.</li>
                                <li>Whether the person works and has family dependants</li>
                                <li>The persons financial position and whether they have a place to live</li>
                                <li>The strength of the evidence against the person.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="our-services-text">
                                If your bail is refused it is important to remember that bail will only be granted in limited circumstances. These circumstances could be a change in the police evidence or a change in your personal circumstances such as parental responsibilities.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is also important to know that if you are on bail for a serious offence and you are further charged with a second serious offence while you were on bail for the first offence, you will be caught by schedule two of the Bail Act 1982. The Court will require you to show exceptional circumstances as to why you should not be kept in custody.

                                Family violence is a serious issue for our communities and is taken very seriously by the Courts.

                                Some of the comments the Courts have made are concerning Violence Restraining Orders are:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                â€˜â€¦that violence restraining orders are not to be made merely because of general feelings of animosity between the parties or because it seems preferable that contact between the parties might be minimised or preventedâ€™: Low v Weber [1999] WASCA 274.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                â€¦â€™it is not possible to deal with the issue of a restraining order simply on the basis of what is prudent or desirable. Regard must be had to the legal rights of the partiesâ€™. McWaters v Shirley [2005] WASC 188 [29]

                                If you have children and are currently going through a separation or divorce, family mediation is a compulsory step to developing a parenting plan.

                                Depending on the individual circumstances, mediation may not be a suitable process. In such circumstances a 60I certificate will be issued by the family dispute resolution practitioner which can then be submitted along with your Family Court application.
